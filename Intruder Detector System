Build an intruder detector (anti-thief) system for home security. The system must be armed
(enabled) using a master switch. If the switch is off, none of the security features will work. For
security purposes, first there is an ultrasonic distance sensor installed at the front door. If an
intruder comes within 2.5m of the sensor, it will light up a bright lamp. The lamp will turn off if the
intruder backs away, but not before 5 seconds. If instead the thief approaches the door and tries to
turn the door handle, a force sensor within the handle detects the intrusion attempt. In such a case,
a security alarm also starts ringing, and will continue to ring until the thief has moved away from the
door (at least 2.5m).
Components to be used on Tinkercad: slider (master on/off switch), ultrasonic distance sensor, flex
sensor or force sensor, piezo (buzzer), light bulb.
